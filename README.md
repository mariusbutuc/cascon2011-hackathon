## Hackathon - part of [CASCON 2011](https://www-927.ibm.com/cascon/)

### Day #1:
 * met the team,
 * got our challenge: a cross-platform(_Android, Blackberry, iOS_) mobile app for [the Scott Mission](http://www.scottmission.com/) ([touching video](http://youtu.be/7mxNk1cS8Kg)),
 * had lunch... _yummy_,
 * discussed requirements and approaches,
 * put pen to paper and came up with [a wireframe for the app](https://cacoo.com/diagrams/JJkTRyaFS9KyZKLM),
 * tinkered with [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) examples,
 * given that the ladies from the Scott Mission were very interested in **push notifications**, we considered [Urban Airship](http://urbanairship.com/).

## Tips & Tricks

1. Don't forget to switch to the openjdk if you're using the IBM jdk  
on Ubuntu `sudo update-alternatives --config java` is pretty neat!
2. Don't forget, to rotate the Android emulator in landscape mode, hit [`Ctrl+F12`](http://stackoverflow.com/q/4535298/341929)?
